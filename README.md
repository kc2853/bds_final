# BDS Spring 2020 Final Project
While the market of cryptocurrency has been an unprecedentedly volatile one in the past decade, we explore the case with Ethereum since 2019 such that we gather, preprocess, and process data from three main sources in an attempt to model its price: price data itself, blockchain data, and data from Twitter. Here, blockchain data refer to on-chain data such as average gas price, total hash rate in the blockchain network, number of existing addresses, etc. all of which signify the health of the network as a global data structure. As for Twitter, we note the advent of so-called Crypto Twitter, a Twitter clique of investors, traders, engineers, celebrities, and speculators, and thus utilize the tweets by top Crypto Twitter influencers in our prediction model. Incorporating these data in addition to Ethereum's price data, we observe that our model is able to generate predictions with smaller error when compared to traditional time series models.
