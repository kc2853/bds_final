"VinnyLingham","1109546035821584385","2019-03-23 20:02:43","61","5","BTC should have increased the block size. Clearly LN was not going to be ready ‚Äúin 18 months‚Äù as claimed over 2 years ago. ‚ÄúStore of Value‚Äù hypothesis is flawed sub-scale and getting to scale is limited by the block size, possibly a catch-22.

"VinnyLingham","1109546028267642880","2019-03-23 20:02:42","22","3","Right now, I‚Äôm agnostic on all three forks for various reasons, but specifically, as it relates to how the various communities relay their world views and try to compete."
"VinnyLingham","1109546026426355713","2019-03-23 20:02:41","23","3","The main forks (BTC, BCH and BSV) are all competing to solve problems relating to a combination of scale, utility, adoption and security, amongst other goals."

Speculation alone will not do this - we need real world applications and usage."
"VinnyLingham","1004450403973398528","2018-06-06 19:50:12","38","4","Again, my views are predicated on the fact that relative to the size of the crypto economy there is very little value add to the real world economies still. Disruption takes time but greed and fomo are impatient. When these two collide, the best and worst come to the fore."
