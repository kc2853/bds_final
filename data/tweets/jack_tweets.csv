"jack","1053312167334703105","2018-10-19 15:49:24","191","27","P.S. I appreciate I could be wrong about this. If I am, I‚Äôll admit it, and work to fix. I‚Äôm committed to addressing this crisis in our city, and mindful of the urgency required. Here‚Äôs the mayor‚Äôs thoughts on the matter: https://t.co/Ef0Xz54FHR"
"jack","1053312162762960896","2018-10-19 15:49:23","134","5","I hope this helps add some color to the conversation. I‚Äôd love to see the Mayor get the funds and support she needs to do her job. And I‚Äôm committed to helping do just that. We need to have long term solutions in place, not quick acts to make us feel good for one moment in time."
"jack","1053312158220472320","2018-10-19 15:49:22","76","5","The Square/Stripe issue isn‚Äôt something the Mayor or Prop C folks can fix directly. I thought it was important to get our considerations out on the table though, so people understand our corporate hesitation and considerations (separate from my personal ones) around this measure."
"jack","1053312151136362496","2018-10-19 15:49:21","146","12","We‚Äôre happy to pay our taxes. We just want to be treated fairly with respect to our peer companies, many of whom are 2-10x larger than us. Otherwise we don‚Äôt know how to practically grow in the city. That‚Äôs heartbreaking for us as we love SF and want to continue to help build it."
"jack","1053312149815091200","2018-10-19 15:49:20","243","47","Hypothetically Square could pay over $20m more in 2019, while Salesforce (4x bigger than Sq) pays less than $10m. Taxes would grow at rates multiple times our adj. revenue, which no company can sustain. Not an issue for Salesforce/Twitter, but unfair to Sq and fintech startups."
"jack","1053312148317716480","2018-10-19 15:49:20","120","19","I admit that while I come at this as a citizen first, there‚Äôs an unfairness I see in my role of CEO of Square (this does not apply to Twitter). Companies like Square and Stripe would be taxed at a significantly larger total contribution than much larger companies like Salesforce."
"jack","1053312146723860480","2018-10-19 15:49:20","109","8","I‚Äôll also posit that we do this discussion a disservice when we only look on the surface and make it us vs. them. I find that distracting and diminishing and it‚Äôs all too common in today‚Äôs discourse. Let‚Äôs instead focus on the real issue, the policy, and whether it will work."
"jack","1053312144932925440","2018-10-19 15:49:19","104","11","I‚Äòd love to see a meeting between the mayor and the @OurHomeSF (Yes on C) folks to work through the disconnect. We all have the same goals, but it doesn‚Äôt seem we‚Äôre talking enough directly. I‚Äôve been attempting to put this together. And I just received word this is in the works!"
"jack","1053312143360020480","2018-10-19 15:49:19","91","11","While I understand an influx of cash is attractive, the mayor has said she doesn‚Äôt have the accountability or controls she needs to manage it well. Ultimately, she is the only one on the hook to make this work. If she doesn‚Äôt feel she can, we need to listen and understand why."
"jack","1053312141657178112","2018-10-19 15:49:18","373","56","A thread on San Francisco‚Äôs Prop C. As a citizen of SF since 1999, and likely for the rest of my life, my primary objective is to help set our newly elected Mayor @LondonBreed up for success. That means addressing homelessness long-term in a scalable way, with accountability."

Someday maybe we can have most of our conversations debates and disagreements right here on Twitter for everyone to see. https://t.co/54oMp4LA0d"
"jack","1027284328386969600","2018-08-08 20:04:04","242","57","Some fair points here. We certainly have a lot of work to do to help journalists do their jobs better. That‚Äôs our intent. Help with reach, balance, and economic incentives. We‚Äôre behind on those last two. Shouldn‚Äôt take away from skepticism and critical thinking tho. https://t.co/2rlNWJnrjO"

We need to figure out how to help with economic incentives too. We‚Äôre behind on that, but thinking deeply about it. Open to great and scalable ideas."

We don‚Äôt mean to shift the work here. We must build tools to help (and need to work together to do that). We can‚Äôt be a useful service without the integrity journalists bring. https://t.co/sARY4SgsHt"

We‚Äôre going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories."
