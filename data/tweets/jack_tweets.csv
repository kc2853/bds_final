It will take many years to develop a sound, scalable, and usable decentralized standard for social media that paves the path to solving the challenges listed above.

It will allow us to access and contribute to a much larger corpus of public conversation, focus our efforts on building open recommendation algorithms which promote healthy conversation, and will force us to be far more innovative than in the past."

I’m committed to addressing this crisis in our city, and mindful of the urgency required. Here’s the mayor’s thoughts on the matter: https://t.co/Ef0Xz54FHR"

"jack","1053312158220472320","2018-10-19 15:49:22","76","5","The Square/Stripe issue isn’t something the Mayor or Prop C folks can fix directly. I thought it was important to get our considerations out on the table though, so people understand our corporate hesitation and considerations (separate from my personal ones) around this measure."
"jack","1053312151136362496","2018-10-19 15:49:21","146","12","We’re happy to pay our taxes. We just want to be treated fairly with respect to our peer companies, many of whom are 2-10x larger than us. Otherwise we don’t know how to practically grow in the city. That’s heartbreaking for us as we love SF and want to continue to help build it."
"jack","1053312149815091200","2018-10-19 15:49:20","243","47","Hypothetically Square could pay over $20m more in 2019, while Salesforce (4x bigger than Sq) pays less than $10m. Taxes would grow at rates multiple times our adj. revenue, which no company can sustain. Not an issue for Salesforce/Twitter, but unfair to Sq and fintech startups."

I find that distracting and diminishing and it’s all too common in today’s discourse. Let’s instead focus on the real issue, the policy, and whether it will work."

"jack","1053312143360020480","2018-10-19 15:49:19","91","11","While I understand an influx of cash is attractive, the mayor has said she doesn’t have the accountability or controls she needs to manage it well. Ultimately, she is the only one on the hook to make this work. If she doesn’t feel she can, we need to listen and understand why."

"jack","1037399180224987136","2018-09-05 17:56:53","339","113","Bias in algorithms is an important topic. Our responsibility is to understand, measure, and reduce accidental bias due to factors such as the quality of the data used to train our algorithms. This is an extremely complex challenge facing everyone applying artificial intelligence."
"jack","1037399167650459648","2018-09-05 17:56:50","242","70","Our technology was using a decision making criteria that considers the behavior of people following these accounts. We decided that wasn’t fair, and corrected. We‘ll always improve our technology and algorithms to drive healthier usage, and measure the impartiality of outcomes."
"jack","1037399156460081152","2018-09-05 17:56:47","289","152","In the spirit of accountability and transparency: recently we failed our intended impartiality. Our algorithms were unfairly filtering 600,000 accounts, including some members of Congress, from our search auto-complete and latest results. We fixed it. But how did it happen?"
"jack","1037399145282265095","2018-09-05 17:56:44","208","54","We build our policies and rules with a principle of impartiality: objective criteria, rather than on the basis of bias, prejudice, or preferring the benefit to one person over another for improper reasons. If we learn we failed to create impartial outcomes, we  work hard to fix."
"jack","1037399132116340736","2018-09-05 17:56:41","257","61","A default to free expression left unchecked can generate risks and dangers for people. It’s important Twitter distinguishes between people’s opinions and behaviors, and disarms behavior intending to silence another person, or adversely interfere with their universal human rights."
"jack","1037399119810232321","2018-09-05 17:56:38","285","78","Our early and strong defense of open and free exchange has enabled Twitter to be THE platform for activists, marginalized communities, whistleblowers, journalists, governments and the most influential people around the world. Twitter will always default to open and free exchange."
"jack","1037399105306324993","2018-09-05 17:56:35","555","152","Twitter cannot rightly serve as a public square if it’s constructed around the personal opinions of its makers. We believe a key driver of a thriving public square is the fundamental human right of freedom of opinion and expression."
"jack","1037399093084151808","2018-09-05 17:56:32","251","65","We believe many people use Twitter as a digital public square. They gather from all around the world to see what’s happening, and have a conversation about what they see."

"jack","1037339485154013184","2018-09-05 13:59:40","637","151","What made it possible was the fact that I was born into a nation built by the people, for the benefit of the people. Where I could work hard to make something happen which was bigger than me. I treasure that, and will do everything in my power to protect it from harm. Thank you."
"jack","1037339480196345856","2018-09-05 13:59:39","385","83","In closing, when I think of our work, I think of my mom and dad in St. Louis, a Democrat and a Republican. For them Twitter has always been a source of joy, learning and connection to something bigger. They’re proud of me, proud of Twitter, and proud of what made it all possible."
"jack","1037339472654999561","2018-09-05 13:59:37","234","69","Today we‘re committing to the people, and this committee, to do that work, and do it openly. We‘re here to contribute to a healthy public square, not compete to have the only one. We know that’s the only way our business thrives, and helps us all defend against these new threats."
"jack","1037339467537887232","2018-09-05 13:59:36","227","67","But we all have to think a lot bigger, and decades past today. We must ask the question: “what is Twitter incentivizing people to do (or not do), and why?” The answers will lead to tectonic shifts in how Twitter, and our industry, operates. Required changes won’t be fast or easy."
"jack","1037339461074472961","2018-09-05 13:59:35","185","60","We’ve learned from 2016 and more recently from other nation’s elections how to help protect the integrity of our elections.

"jack","1037339454355238913","2018-09-05 13:59:33","257","86","We’ve seen positive results from our work. We‘re now removing over 200% more accounts for violating our policies. We’re identifying and challenging 8-10 million suspicious accounts every week. And we’re thwarting over a half million accounts from logging in to Twitter every day."
"jack","1037339447489167361","2018-09-05 13:59:31","193","63","We‘ve made significant progress recently on tactical solutions like identification of many forms of manipulation intending to artificially amplify information, more transparency around who buys ads and how they are targeted, and challenging suspicious logins and account creation."
"jack","1037339440602132483","2018-09-05 13:59:30","242","81","We weren’t expecting any of this when we created Twitter over 12 years ago. We acknowledge the real-world negative consequences of what happened, and we take full responsibility to fix it. We can’t do this alone, and that’s why this conversation is so important, and why I’m here."
"jack","1037339436164558848","2018-09-05 13:59:29","217","64","Our interests are aligned with the American people and this committee. If we don’t find scalable solutions to the problems we’re now seeing, we lose our business, and we continue to threaten the original privilege and liberty we were given to create Twitter in the first place."
"jack","1037339428526731264","2018-09-05 13:59:27","257","101","Abuse, harassment, troll armies, propaganda through bots and human coordination, misinformation campaigns, and divisive filter bubbles…that‘s not a healthy public square. Worse, a relatively small number of bad-faith actors were able to game Twitter to have an outsized impact."
"jack","1037339421073436679","2018-09-05 13:59:25","263","89","We aren’t proud of how that free and open exchange has been weaponized and used to distract and divide people, and our nation. We found ourselves unprepared and ill-equipped for the immensity of the problems we’ve acknowledged."
"jack","1037339416010870785","2018-09-05 13:59:24","235","66","We‘re extremely proud of helping to increase the accessibility and velocity of a simple, free and open exchange. We believe people will learn faster by being exposed to a wide range of opinions and ideas, and it helps to make our nation, and the world, feel a little bit smaller."
"jack","1037339409862025216","2018-09-05 13:59:22","249","75","In any public space, you’ll find inspired ideas, and you’ll find lies and deception. People who want to help others and unify, and people who want to hurt others and themselves and divide. What separates a physical and digital public space is greater accessibility and velocity."
"jack","1037339403696398336","2018-09-05 13:59:21","269","71","First, I wanted to step back and share our view of Twitter’s role in the world. We believe many people use Twitter as a digital public square. They gather from all around the world to see what’s happening, and have a conversation about what they see."
