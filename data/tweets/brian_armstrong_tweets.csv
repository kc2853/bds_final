The chain that manages to ship some of these scalability, privacy, decentralized identity, and developer tool solutions will have a big leg up."
"brian_armstrong","1235314503493070850","2020-03-04 21:21:43","71","8","Anyway, I thought it was an awesome story, with some great pattern matching to crypto.\n\nHistory doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme."
"brian_armstrong","1235314266636464133","2020-03-04 21:20:46","54","6","The underlying scripting language of each blockchain, is a big part to get right on the developer tool side as well.

"brian_armstrong","1235313731225214982","2020-03-04 21:18:39","73","4","4. Developer Tools - just making it super simple for developers to build apps, publish them, and get distribution. The apps need to ""just work"" for users, so there will need to be a bigger focus on UX (standardization on the decentralized identity piece above will help with this)"
"brian_armstrong","1235313360301891584","2020-03-04 21:17:10","83","6","Decentralized identity will also enable users to have reputation scores (similar to FICO or credit scores today), and attestation or claims around KYC, which I think will unlock a bunch of use cases."
"brian_armstrong","1235313137248874501","2020-03-04 21:16:17","106","14","3.

"brian_armstrong","1235312869811597313","2020-03-04 21:15:13","142","20","2. Privacy - perhaps a contrarian view, but I think we'll need privacy coins, just like we needed HTTPS as the default on the web, for many use cases in crypto long term.

"brian_armstrong","1235312424590495748","2020-03-04 21:13:27","118","14","For me, the biggest areas of development I see that I think we need to get right as an industry are:\n\n1.
